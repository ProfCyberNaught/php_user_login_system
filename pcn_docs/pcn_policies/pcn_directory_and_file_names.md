# Directory and File Naming Policy

Here is our Directory and File Naming Policy:

### Directory Naming Policy:

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_) to separate words
- Use underscores (_) instead of spaces in directory names
- All directories must start with the prefix: ```pcn_```
- Use clear and concise names that accurately describe the contents of the directory
- Use singular nouns for directory names, unless the contents are plural (e.g. ```image``` instead of ```images``` if there's only one image in the directory)

**Examples:**

- ```pcn_blog_posts/```
- ```pcn_images/```
- ```pcn_styles/```
- ```pcn_scripts/```
- ```pcn_vendors/```
- ```pcn_config/```

### File Naming Policy:

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_) to separate words
- Use clear and concise names that accurately describe the contents of the file
- Use underscores (_) instead of spaces in file names
- Use a consistent naming convention for related files
- All files must start with the prefix: ```pcn_``` (excludes: index files)
- Only use ```.php``` files for pages and not ```.html``` files
- All files to be included within the pages (```include() or require_once()```) must have the ```.inc``` extension (excludes: JS, CSS, Images)
- All JS files must have the extension ```.js```
- All CSS files must have the extension ```.css```

**Examples:**

- ```index.html```
- ```pcn_dashboard_style.css```
- ```pcn_validation_script.js```
- ```pcn_project_logo.svg```
- ```pcn_dashboard.php```

#### IMPORTANT NOTICE:

These rules may change or additional rules may be applied as the project develops. Please check back on a regular basis to make sure you are still adhering to all the required policies.
