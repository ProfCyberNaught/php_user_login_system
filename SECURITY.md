## Disclosure Policy

PHP User Login System has a 5 step disclosure policy, that is upheld to the best of our ability.

1. Security report received and is assigned a primary handler (normally the core maintainer). This person will coordinate the fix and release process.
2. Problem is confirmed and, a list of all affected versions is determined. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
3. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported. These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending further communication and potential announcements.
4. A suggested publishing date for this vulnerability fix is chosen and you will be notified.
5. On the publication date, the changes are pushed to the public repository and new documentation released.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it’s important that we follow the release process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a consistent manner.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be posted in the security section, release notes, documentations, and potentially the discussions board. If you would credit text within these postings, please let us know within your initial communciations.
